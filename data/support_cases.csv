[10:09] Customer: No, I haven't used any products, but I do sweat a lot during my workouts. 

[10:10] Support Agent: That could be a factor. I recommend cleaning the mat regularly with a gentle soap and water solution to help maintain its grip. Would you like some tips on how to clean it?

[10:11] Customer: Yes, that would be great! 

[10:12] Support Agent: Sure! Just mix a small amount of mild soap with warm water. Use a soft cloth to wipe the mat down and then rinse with clean water. Make sure to let it air dry completely before using it again. 

[10:13] Customer: Got it! I’ll try that. But what if it doesn’t improve?

[10:14] Support Agent: If you find that the grip doesn’t improve after cleaning, please let us know. We can discuss options such as a replacement or return, depending on your preference. 

[10:15] Customer: Thank you! I’ll give it a try and reach out if I still have issues.

[10:19] Support: First, make sure the helmet is clean and dry. Then, locate the area where the padding is loose. You can use a little bit of fabric glue if it’s not sticking back on its own. Just apply a small amount and press it down firmly for a few seconds.
